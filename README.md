# Airfair - Tech test

## What you need to do

At Airfair, we aim to provide video-based events. Trade fair organisers will be able to onboard companies that we call exhibitors on our platform so that they can interact with visitors (which are also professionals). One possibility they have to interact with the visitors is by hosting a content session.

The goal of this test is to create the following pages for our exhibitor app regarding the Content Session model: you will help our exhibitors to list, create, read, update and delete content sessions. You should thus provide:

- A page to list all the content sessions
- A way to look up a content session
- A way to create and update a content sessions
- An action to delete a content session

## Data

You should find in this repository a JSON file containing some content sessions. The fields are pretty much self explanatory and we expect you to find a way to display all those fields in the most convenient way according to you.

## Tech tools

You can use the language, framework and the tools of your choice. Chose the ones that you're most familiar with. If you prefer to use the same stack as us, please note that we use ReactJS and the create-react-app framework with TypeScript.

## What we will pay attention to

- The code style
- The relevance of the framework/language choice 
- If you added any kind of tests
- The look of the end result: we're not expecting a pixel perfect result but we really appreciate good UI/UX
- A bonus point will be attributed to those who host the project (Heroku, Netlify, Vercel... we're not picky :P)

If you did anything that you think is noticeable, please do not refrain from telling us, we will definitely take a look at it!
